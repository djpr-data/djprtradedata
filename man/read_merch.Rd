Obtains merchandise exports data from ABS.Stat
(\url{https://stat.data.abs.gov.au/index.aspx?DatasetCode=MERCH_EXP}).
}
\details{
The ABS will not supply data frames of over 1m rows using the
ABS.Stat API. For this reason, you cannot download more than 1 year at a
time worth of data using this function, as this is around the point at which
the 1m row limit is reached.
